# TSMCN: Two-stream MeshCNN for Key Anatomical Segmentation on the Liver Surface

TSMCN is a novel deep learning framework designed for key anatomical segmentation on the liver surface using 3D triangular meshes. This project leverages the power of MeshCNN and extends it to a two-stream architecture for enhanced segmentation capabilities.

## Overview

TSMCN aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of liver surface segmentation by employing a dual-stream approach. The main code, datasets, and pre-trained models have been uploaded to facilitate replication of our results. We are currently working on refining the code structure for easier reproduction and will provide a comprehensive tutorial soon.

## Getting Started

### Code and Data

- The core codebase and data required to run TSMCN are now available.
- Pre-trained models are included to help users quickly start experimenting with the framework.

### Upcoming Tutorial

- We are in the process of creating a detailed tutorial that will guide users through the process of annotating mesh edge labels using software like MeshLab and Blender.
- The tutorial will cover how to save annotations in the eSeg format, which is compatible with both MeshCNN and our proposed TSMCN model for mesh segmentation tasks.


## Other implementations

- This project is built upon the [MeshCNN](https://github.com/ranahanocka/MeshCNN) framework, which is a general-purpose deep neural network for 3D triangular meshes. We extend our sincere thanks to the creators of MeshCNN for their valuable contribution to the field.
